# Buster's beliefs about life, the universe, and everything

_Last updated by Buster Benson on December 31st, 2017._

*About this document:* This public, living, document was created in April of 2012 and attempts to capture my beliefs about the nature of life, the universe, and everything in as few words as possible. All changes are tracked. Rather than attempting to avoid all errors in this doc, I'm attempting to be as specific as possible and to quickly correct errors when they become obvious.

*Objectives:* My primary goal here is to get smarter over time by identifying new connections and inconsistencies so I can course-correct when necessary. Secondarily, I'd also like to extend an invitiation for others to spark conversations with me about anything they find interesting and to also help keep me accountable.

## Beliefs
A belief is an personal interpretation of available experience and data on a given subject. The subject can be anything, from "what is the best burger in SF?" to "how did the universe begin, and how will it end?" to "how easy should it be to buy a gun?" and beyond. I've broken them up into three broad categories: 1) beliefs about how the nature, consciousness, and the universe seem to be to me (both objectively and subjectively), and 2) what I believe are the best realistically enforceable legal and policy frameworks for us to protect, inspire, and govern society by on a number of topics.

### HOW THINGS ARE: On the nature of reality and how things are
How nature, consciousness, and the universe seem to be to me (both objectively and subjectively).

*Earth: climate change*

*Earth: long-term trends towards progress*
* Technology has or will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics, energy).
* As history progresses, power will tend to be more quickly redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top.
* Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others.

*Earth: existential threats*

*Life: aliens*
* Non-carbon-based life forms exist.
* Aliens exist, but we will most likely discover their creations (ie. robots they made) before we discover them. 
* Aliens will probably discover our own robots before they discover us.
* The vast majority of intelligent beings throughout the universe are probably more similar to robots and cyborgs than organically evolved life.

*Life: consciousness and free will*

*Life: medicine*
* Acupuncture works, somehow.

*Life: origins*

*Life: evolution*
* Micro and macro evolution happens.

*Philosophy: death and the afterlife*
* We will die.
* There is no afterlife.

*Philosophy: purpose of life*
* There is no official purpose or meaning granted to our lives. 
* It's okay to identify our own objectives in life and call them a purpose.
* Memento mori is a useful tool for remembering you're alive.

*Philosophy: search for truth*
* Most questions have no answer (but asking them and talking about them anyway is often entertaining).
* I subscribe to Hume's Fork, which claims that there are two kinds of knowledge: matters of fact, and relations of ideas. Matters of fact aren’t accessible to us—we can never know something for certain, only that it hasn't been proven wrong yet. We can only create a self-referencing network of ideas that are related to each other. "2 + 2 = 4" and "My name is Buster" are both conclusively true if we agree to the definitions and relations between each word and symbol.
* Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely.

*Philosophy: Stoicism*

*Pseudoscience: astrology*
* Astrology can be fun entertainment, like the Myers Briggs test.
* Astrology can stunt healthier forms of analysis if taken literally and seriously.

*Psychology: cognitive limits and biases*
* The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe.
* We have many implicit associations that lead to bias.
* We're susceptible to many cognitive biases and logical fallacies, because our brains require them to get any thinking done within our constraints of time and energy.

*Psychology: prayer and meditation*

*Psychology: tulpas*

*Psychology: personality tests*

*Physics: laws of physics*
* Nothing in our universe can travel faster than light.
* Perception of time can be sped up or slowed down, but not reversed (forwards time travel is possible, backwards is not).

*Spirituality: God, angels, demons, and souls*
* Souls don't exist as separate from the physical body.
* The gods of organized religion don't exist.
* Angels, demons, and other spirits exist as antropomorphised agents in our minds that are useful shortcuts for abstract concepts (see tulpas).
* There is no heaven or hell.

*Supernatural: ghosts*

*Supernatural: law of attraction*
* Intention can't create reality (it just primes our perception of it, and makes us more likely to notice opportunities).

*Technology: artificial intelligence*

*Technology: teleportation*

*Technology: time travel*

*Universe: origins*
* Something like the Big Bang happened, and will probably happen again.
* Something existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them).

*Universe: multiverse*
* Other dimensions and universes exist.

*Universe: structure*
* We probably live in a simulation.


### HOW THINGS SHOULD BE: On rights, laws, governance of society, and how things should be
What I believe are the best realistically enforceable legal and policy frameworks for us to protect, inspire, and govern society by.

*Abortion and birth control*

*Assisted suicide*

*Death penalty*

*Discrimination: general*

*Discrimination: gender*

*Discrimination: racial*

*Drugs*

*Education*

*Elections and voting*

*Extinction*

*Free speech*

*Gun control*

*Harassment and abuse*

*Health care*

*Hunting*

*Immigration*

*Income: inequality*

*Income: universal basic income*

*Income: welfare*

*Marriage*

*Nuclear weapons*

*Prison and sentences*

*Privacy*

*Vaccinations*

## Personal self-reflections
